The dataset includes 14828 images.
Brand-logos are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -4째 to +4째 horizontally and -4째 to +4째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between 0 and +23 percent
